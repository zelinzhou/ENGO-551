  </br>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;fontsize:20">
      Even though the future is unpredicitable. But I still have a personal plan for the recent five years of my future.

    </br>

    After graduation, I would like to continue my study as a master student. My faviorate topics in Geomatics Engineering is GIS or Data analysis. So I will most likly to participate any studyings related to them. After
    master degree, I would like to go to a company that are related to GIS or Data analysis. I want to start my career as a basic engineering technican. Through the working, I could accumulate and learn more experience and knowledge about the industry. Which
    would help me in the industry and even the later jobs.
