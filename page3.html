      When I first came to university of Calgary, I was living in residence in campus. It was a great experience for me  since I never lived in such a school community. I met a lot of friends that from different countries. I also get the chance to
      eat the foot cooked in dinning center. Overall, it was an awesome experience for me!
    </p>

    <h3>Activities</h3>

    <p>
      After came to Univeristy of Calgary, I joined a couple clubs and school teams. Even though I quit all of them now due to the busy studying and other stuff, I still remember the experience and life during the time I was working there.

      During the time in University of Calgary Solarcar Team, I learned a lot of things. I learned how to communicate with others to work for a common goal. I learned how to use Git Hub and other software tools to coorporate in a big project.
      I also  practice my programming skills. Last year, I quit the team because of studying, and there are couple team memebers who joined the team early quit too. However, we also miss the time when we met each other and discuss about the project progress and
      other details every week.

      I didn't joined Gaming design club for long time. I found out that gaming design is not my interest and I decided to quite.
